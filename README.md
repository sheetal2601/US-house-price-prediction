# US-house-price-prediction

Project Overview
The House Price Prediction in the US project is focused on predicting house prices based on a dataset containing various features
 Predicting house prices is a common and essential task in the real estate industry, and it can be beneficial for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

The project includes the following key components:

XGBoost Model Training
To build and train an XGBoost model for house price prediction, we've used the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing to clean, transform, and prepare it for XGBoost model training.

Feature Engineering: We may have engineered new features or applied feature selection techniques to enhance model performance.

XGBoost Model Development: XGBoost is utilized to create a predictive model that can handle regression tasks effectively. The hyperparameters of the XGBoost model are fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the XGBoost model's performance using appropriate regression metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared, or any other relevant metrics.
